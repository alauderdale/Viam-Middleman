						Our Founder
					%h5.text-uppercase
						Jeff Johnson
					%p
						Jeff Johnson is an entrepreneur and outdoor enthusiast with more than 25 years of experience in telecommunications. Throughout his career, Jeff’s focus has always been on solving real-world communications problems – like enabling 4G wireless in remote locations in the Rocky Mountains or helping the World Cup meet the telecommunications needs of every player, fan, press person and local dignitary in attendance.
					%p
						After years of doing business around the world and working with best-of-breed communications, Jeff often became frustrated when he couldn’t keep in touch and stay productive in the places he most wanted to be – in ski areas, national parks or remote mountain communities. Realizing that there were millions of others who shared this frustration, he founded VIAM with a unique vision – to help people conduct business and stay connected, wherever and whenever they travel.
